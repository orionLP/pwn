# Welcome to pwn

This is a repository in which i upload ctfs, from tryhackme, htb, and portswigger. The following is a list of what is in each directory:

- ctf: files used while solving the ctf, divided in htb and tryhackme.
- portswigger: code used when solving some of the labs of portswigger.
- vault: obsidian vaults in which i wrote quicknotes when solving a ctf (note that these are not "clean writeups" as they usually have other things i tested during the ctf, but they contain the full path from a scan to getting the last flag). Divided in tryhackme and htb.

I hope you might find something useful here, or at least that you enjoy the contents.
