For example, if giving nothing for the url but giving a document successfully creates a cover. We are actually able to retrieve the pdf from the website via the endpoint we are given in the response.

I see nothing different in the metadata from what i upload and what i get back

If i give a url and a document, the image is the thing that given back, otherwise the document is given back
