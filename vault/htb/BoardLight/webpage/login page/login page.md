The first thing to do is gather as much as possible on the behaviour and characteristics of this second web page:

- [[login nmap scripts]]: now we have a good sitemap created with an nmap script crawler
- [[search for cve]]: for an authenticated user it should be possible to get RCE into the application
- The application has both a [[login]] and a [[forgot password]] functionality.
