In this case we can find a gitbucket instance running behind a proxy. Most of the functionality is locked behind a login. Other things to note are that there is a redirect after a login, which we might be able to use, and that the following file is open for us to see 

```xml 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" xml:lang="en-US">
  <id>tag:caption.htb,2013:gitbucket</id>
  <title>GitBucket's activities</title>
  <link type="application/atom+xml" rel="self" href="http://caption.htb:8080/activities.atom"/>

### EASY PASSWORD

Turns out there is a sign in password 
- user: root
- password: root
Now we have access to [[gitbucket]]
