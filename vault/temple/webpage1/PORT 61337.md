## LOGIN SITE

Any user is basically redirected to the endpoint 'http://10.10.215.152:61337/login', which only features a login site. 

During the dummy attempts i made i noticed the following:

![[Screenshot from 2024-06-30 11-58-41.png]]

So the page is actively searching for certain characters, how about we just try to send garbage and see what triggers a response. So i did a little code to test which characters actually did it:

```python
import requests
import string
import re

if __name__ == "__main__":
  print('Beggining searching for matches')
  for character in string.punctuation:
    r = requests.post('http://10.10.215.152:61337/login', data={'username':'admin' + character,'password':'a'})
    if re.search('Hacking attempt detected!',r.text) is not None:
      print(f'Found match for {character}')
```

```txt
Beggining searching for matches
Found match for #
Found match for &
Found match for '
Found match for ;
Found match for _
```
(same characters for both username and password)

My first impression is that it is using bash at some point, but maybie others apply. (the most common special characters are for python though)

## LOOKING AT THE SOURCE CODE AND OTHERS
  
Nothing out of the ordinary, only a post and simple css
wappalizer seems to not detect anything
## FUZZES

```

All of it seems to be locked after the login.
\
After a long time i looked a bit at what i would have to do and it seemed that although some parts are locked for us now, we can still access some resources inside those directories (they are not locked).

Therefore run a recursive step with the small (otherwise at least i have found that with my resources it might take a **long** time).

fuzz for the /temporary directory
```bash
dev                     [Status: 403, Size: 239, Words: 27, Lines: 5, Duration: 2277ms]
```

From there we continue onwards:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ffuf -u http://10.10.65.145:61337/temporary/dev/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/Common-PHP-Filenames.txt  

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ffuf -u http://10.10.65.145:61337/temporary/dev/SUBDIR -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt:SUBDIR 

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ffuf -u http://10.10.65.145:61337/temporary/dev/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/Frontpage.fuzz.txt
```

After a bit and basically repeating with **/temporary/dev/**FUZZ and the medium one we get **/newacc**.

We find here that we can actually register for a new account:

and thus we can now [[login]] inside the webpage.
## INJECTION ATTEMPTS

- sql (idk maybie it's a little sqlite):
  Using sqlmap -> at least risk=3 did not find anything.
