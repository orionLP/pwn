Optimize my routine in the Linux environment:

1 - Clearing the cache: The /var/cache folder can store temporary files that are necessary and take up disk space. It is recommended to clean it periodically.

2 - Checking system logs: The system logs, located in /var/log, can grow quickly and take up a lot of disk space. Check them regularly and clean up old files.

3 - System update: Keeping the operating system up to date is important to ensure the security and proper functioning of the system. Regularly check for available updates and install them.

4 - Resource Usage Monitoring: Regularly check CPU, memory and disk usage to identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues.
