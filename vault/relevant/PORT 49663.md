Actually, for this one i was quite lost (lots of things to see, none of them which yielded result, so i looked at this one).

Turns out there is a directory which allows you to access the same directory as the public samba share, so it is the case that we can simply do a RFI, and execute some code.

Take the Dysco php shell and upload it to the server (although this is not a full shell)

```bash
smb: \> put Dysco.php notsus.php
putting file Dysco.php as \notsus.php (9.5 kb/s) (average 9.5 kb/s)
```

Somehow however
