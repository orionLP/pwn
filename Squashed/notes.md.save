## WELCOME TO SQUASHED 

This machine supposedly teaches NFS misconfigurations and user management. Hope you enjoy :).

```

The server has a web server rpcbind (a service for running procedures (functions) on the network to then be transmitted back to the client) and a nfs_acl server (used to access files from that server 
the client has only to request an open of a file and a read from it, as if it where in its own). 

The webpage shows a furniture web app (i suppose to buy furniture). 

Question: Why does a furniture app need to retrieve files and do calculations on a server?

# ITERATION 2

The people at htb seem to try to scan all the ports (just in case), it seems as a good practice since i missed some open ports. Also, you can specify nmap speed (-T4 seems to do it) (which is quite needed).

```{sh}

nmap -p- --min-rate 1000 -T4 10.10.11.191

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-01-07 22:35 CET
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.191

80/tcp    open  http
111/tcp   open  rpcbind
2049/tcp  open  nfs
33769/tcp open  unknown
40447/tcp open  unknown
42635/tcp open  unknown
55043/tcp open  unknown

```

They usually do a more speedy scan to know which ports are active and then use a global variable to store them and do a full scan on them.
# ITERATION 3

It is something quite odd for you to say
