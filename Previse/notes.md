host is running both an ssh server and an apache server. Let's first find vulns in the apache server

# WEB-APP

information we can get before the actual assesment

the site was created by m4lwhere

One strange thing is that when asking for resources we should have not access to, such accoutns, we are acctually given 
the html web page. taking in account that this is a php based web, it means that it executes before redirection, meaning that 
we can just do whatever we want anyway.

mysql is actually up and running (even though it was not in the nmap)
## users 

admin: newguy
z
## Post explotation

Now we have access to the code of all the files in the web server:

discoveries:
we can upload files to the server with no restrictions 
many times the web-page accesses a mysql database 
user-passwords are hashed in the database
The database previse has credentials root:mySQL_p@ssw0rd!:)

# Inside the machine 

home:

nothing here except the user flag (unreachable for now) and that the user m4lwhere likes to use vim

/var/www:

there exists files with id 1-6 and 24 25


ideas: there was a database storing user information (although passworld are hashed)

```{sh}
mysql -u root -p'mySQL_p@ssw0rd!:)' -e 'SHOW DATABASES;'

remember salts go hash:salt independently of the mode
