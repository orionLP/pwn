Inside the application itself:
- /development/dev.txt: 
    - struts 
    - SMB
    - REST version of an example
    - version 2.5.12
    - weak /etc/shadow, hash crack

## SMB SERVICE

The service has a paswordless share with the file staff.txt with the names of the staff people attached to it.

## USERS & ADMINS

K: web app developer = Kay

In the machine there is a private key for ssh that i can read. After putting it through ssh2john and then using john to crack it, we get the password for the user kay of beeswax. 

J: unkown for now = Jan

Since this one seemed to have weak credentials we brute force this one using the hydra tool, and we get the password for the user jan of armando.
