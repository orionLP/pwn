        <h2>Question 1</h2>
        <p>
            Given the following intentions, which switches do we have to use?
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Enable sys scan: -sS    
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Perform an udp scan: -sU
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Detect the user's operating system: -O
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The versions of the services running on the target: -sV
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    To change verbosity level: -v for level 1, -vv for level 2
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Save results in a greapable format: -oG
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Aggressive mode enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute: -A
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Nmap can reduce the time it takes to do scans using the template option: -T0-5 
                    <br>
                    <strong> 
                        Note: The number after the T is the speed, 0 is the slowest and 5 is the fastest, and 
                        usually, detection is easier when using high numbers 
                    </strong>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    To scan a range of ports use the: -p <i>range</i>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    To activate a script from the nmap scripting library: --script=<i>script_name</i>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Open</strong>: The port is open and is accepting connections. (this means a SYN-ACK packet was recieved)

            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Filtered</strong>: The port is filtered and is dropping packets. (this means no response was recieved, most likely 
                    due to a firewall dropping the packets).

            Types of scans in nmap
        </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>TCP scan</strong>:
                    The scan works by initiating a TCP handshake sending a sync packet to the target. If the target responds with a sync-ack packet, the port is open.
                    If instead the target responds with a RST packet, the port is closed. If there is no response, we assume the target is dropping the packets, probably 
                    due to firewall rules or the port is filtered. This is the most easy to defend against, since the target only needs respond with a RST packet to 
                    seem like a closed port. It is also worth noting that in this scan, we will send an ack packet.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>SYN scan</strong>:
                    This is the same as a TCP scan, but instead of sending an ACK packet, we will send back a 
                    RST packet, so we do not waste time, and the server does not send more SYN-ACK packets 
                    trying to reach us. Some applications will not log connections until they recieve an ACK packet,
                    but it might break unstable applications.
