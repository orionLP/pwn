        <hr>

        <h2>What is this?</h2>

        <p>
            In offensive security one is interested with breaking into systems through exploits, security failures, insecure setups, and the like.
            This is in what red teams and pentesters specialize at. Defensive security, contrary to this, is concerned with 2 things:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Preventing intrusions from happening</li>
            <li>Detecting instrusions once they happen</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Some of the ways this is accomplished are increasing user awareness, managing assets, updating systems, setting up preventive security devices such as 
            a <a href="#firewall">firewall</a> or an <a href="#ids">IDS</a>, or setting logging and monitoring systems. 
        </p>

        
        <h3>SOC</h3>

        <p>
            A SOC, or Security Operations Center, is a team of cyber secrurity professionals that are 
            responsable for monitoring systems and detecing malicious events. Some of the areas of interest are:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Vulnerabilites: fixing vulnerabilites once they are discovered, usually by patching the system. When that is not available then doing other measures is of importance.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Ensuring policy violations are not happening: this is done by monitoring logs and traffic patterns, ensuring the protection of network and systems.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Network intrusion and unauthorized activity: Even if an intrusion occurs it is important to detect it to avoid further damage. 
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Threat intelligence</h3>

        <p>
            Threat intelligence is about gathering information about potential adversaries, their tactics, techniques and procedures. This needs data to be done, which 
            can be collected both from local sources such as logs or external souces such as knowledge bases, forums, and the like. This has to be processed and analysed.
        </p>
        
        <h3>DFIR</h3>

        <p>
            Forensics is the act of investigating crimes, and in the case of digital forensics, it investigates cases of intrusion, cyber espionage, and the like
            through digital systems. Digital forensics focuses on different areas such as system logs, file systems, system memory or network logs. 
        </p>
       
        <p>
            Incident response is the set of methodologies that should be followed in the case of an incident. We understand an incident as a security event such a 
            data breach, a misconfiguration, an intrusion attempt, and the like. In incident response the four major stages:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Preparation: This is about preparing the team for an incident, setting up the tools and the like.</p></li>
            <li><p>Detection and analysis: This is about detecting the incident and analysing it to understand what happened.</p></li>
            <li><p>Containment, eradication and recovery: This is about containing the incident, eradicating it and recovering from it.</p></li>
            <li><p>Post-incident activity: This is about documenting the incident, learning from it, and the like.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p id="firewall">Firewall: A network security device designed to monitor, filter and control incoming and outcoming network trafic based on predetermined rules</p>
        <p id="ids">IDS: A security device or software designed to monitor network traffic searching for malicious activities. In contrast of the firewall, which only regulates traffic based on 
            predetermined rules, an IDS monitors system logs, traffic patterns and the like to detect threats. It is also usually separated between network based and host based.</p>
